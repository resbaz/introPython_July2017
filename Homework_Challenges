# Beginner's Python - Day 1 Homework Challenge

## Challenge Question 1

Create a for loop that will go through the example list given below. If the list item is a number below or equal to 10, add this number to another list for "odd" or "even" numbers. If it's a string, add it to another list.

Sort the contents of these three lists, then print the outputs of all three on separate lines.

An example of the list you might recieve is below, along with some code to help you get started. 

```python
list1 = [1,3.2,"Are you having a nice day?", 2,4,"Difficulty Increased!","10,15,11.5,5,6,9,8.2,7,14.8,15,16,13,["Nested list","What are you","gonna do about it?"]]

odd = []
even = []
stringList = []

for i in list1: #this needs to be edited
    
    if type(list1[i]) is int or type(list1[i]) is float:
        # remember that converting a float to an int always causes it to round down?
        # remember our discussion about modulo, %, to test the remainder?
        if (condition):
            odd.append(list1[i])
    
     elif type(list1[i]) is (condition):
        #perform an action

odd.sort()

```

Using this list, you should get an answer similar to this:


evens list is: [1,2,6,8.2,10]
odds list is: [1,3.2,5,7]
strings list is: ["Are you having a nice day?","Difficulty Increased!"]
