# Beginner's Python - July 2017 Edition

This Python Beginner's workshop wil be running from 10am - 5pm on Monday 24th and Wednesday 26th of July, at the CoLab training space within level 3 of the Eastern Resource Centre, University of Melbourne, Parkville.

This workshop is designed for those trying to explore and learn about the wonders of Python for the very first time. The content is suitable for a range of learners - from those who have never programmed before, to those whoare already proficient in other coding languages. 

You can find installation instructions for both Python 3.6 and Jupyter Notebook in this github repository, in the ["Python Installation Instructions" file](https://github.com/resbaz/introPython_July2017/blob/master/Python_Installation.md). 

You will also find that the content for the workshop is available in both the markdown (\*.md) format, for online viewing, and as an iPython notebooks (\*.ipynb), which will contain useable code fragments, challenges and explanations for the workshop content. This content is mostly adapted from Dan Sandiford's [Python Gitbook](https://dansand.gitbooks.io/resguides-research-with-jupyter/content/), predominantly from the "Python Basics" section.
